In an event marking a significant milestone in her scientific career, Prof. Susana Campino, a renowned expert in the field of Genomics and Infectious Diseases, recently delivered her inaugural lecture. The lecture, presented to a captivated audience of fellow scientists, researchers, students, and loved ones, revolved around the critical role of genomics in understanding and combating infectious diseases, particularly those transmitted by arthropods.

Campino, who has spent the better part of her career deciphering the complex relationships between genes and infectious diseases, highlighted the contribution of genomics in understanding malaria and arboviral infections. These diseases, often transmitted via vectors such as mosquitoes, present a significant global health challenge, especially in regions with tropical climates.

The professor's inaugural lecture was more than just a display of her wealth of knowledge and expertise. It was also an opportunity for her to express gratitude towards her family and team who have supported her throughout her journey.

As members of her team, we could not be more proud or inspired as we extend our heartfelt congratulations to Prof. Susana Campino on this momentous occasion. Working alongside her, we have not only witnessed her tireless dedication to advancing our understanding of genomics and infectious diseases but have also experienced her invaluable mentorship and genuine care for those around her. Her accomplishments stretch far beyond the academic realm; they represent the human qualities of empathy, perseverance, and unwavering commitment to making a difference. It is a privilege to be a part of her journey, and we look forward to supporting her future endeavors as she continues to revolutionize our approach to global health.
