Congratulations to Linfeng on successfully passing his PhD viva!
His thesis focused on developing advanced machine learning models for genomic analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with an emphasis on drug resistance profiling. He implemented a range of cutting-edge approaches, including convolutional, recurrent, and graph neural networks, as well as transfer learning and generative models.
