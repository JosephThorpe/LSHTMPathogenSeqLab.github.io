The 27th International Congress of Entomology (ICE2024) was held in Kyoto, Japan, from August 25 to 30, 2024. Hosted by the Union of the Japanese Societies for Insect Sciences (UJSIS), this international event brings together entomologists and researchers worldwide under the theme “New Discoveries through Consilience.” The congress aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and explore the impact of insects on global challenges such as climate change, food security, and health. The congress also featured an array of specialised sessions, including one on genomic methods organised by Emma, where both Emma and Susana presented on our latest sequencing studies on <i>Aedes</i> and <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes, including insights into our amplicon assays and insecticide resistance. There was a lot of interest in the LSHTM team’s work, likely to lead to further collaborations.
