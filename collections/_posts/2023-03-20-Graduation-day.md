brief:  Members of our team celebrate their PhD's on graduation day
---

Graduation day is a momentous occasion for our PhD students and their families, and a fitting celebration for 2-4 years of hard work and sacrifice. This year, four of our team graduated with PhDs: Paula Gomez-Gonzalez, Amy Ibrahim, Anton Spadar, and Daniel Ward (Garnham Prize winner) (see picture). Many congratulations to the new “Dr”s, and many thanks to Sam Alsford for his mentorship role.
