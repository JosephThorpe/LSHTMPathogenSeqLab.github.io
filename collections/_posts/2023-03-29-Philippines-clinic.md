Members of our team (Jody, Linfeng, Matt) recently ran a bioinformatic analysis clinic at the Research Institute for tropical Medicine, Department of Health in the Philippines, with whom we have collaborated since 2016 on infectious disease genomics and had continuous joint (UKRI) funding. The aim of the clinic was to provide training to biomedical researchers and technicians in the use of bioinformatic tools and techniques for the analysis of genomic data, as well as directly assist them with analysis.  Over two days, the team assisted with AMR, COVID-19, malaria, TB, and Schistosoma genomic, transcriptomics and serological data analysis. 

Overall, the bioinformatic analysis clinic in the Department of Health in the Philippines was a successful endeavor. By providing training and support to healthcare professionals in the use of bioinformatic tools and techniques, we hope to improve patient outcomes and advance the field of bioinformatics in the Philippines and beyond. We look forward to continuing our work in this area and helping to build a strong and capable workforce of bioinformatic professionals in the healthcare industry.
