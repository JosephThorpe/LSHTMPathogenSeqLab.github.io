Our group has published a new study on the invasive Asian mosquito Anopheles stephensi, whose recent emergence in Africa poses a significant threat to malaria control efforts. Using whole-genome sequencing and population structure analysis, we identified key genetic differences between Ethiopian and South Asian isolates. We also detected three mutations associated with insecticide resistance. This represents the first whole-genome population genetics study of invasive An. stephensi, providing critical insights into its geographic dispersal and the molecular basis of insecticide resistance - findings that will inform future surveillance and vector control strategies.
