The Infectious Disease 'Omics course took place at LSHTM from April 28 to May 1, 2025, attracting around 50 participants in a hybrid format, split evenly between in-person and online attendees. This annual course has been successfully run in previous years, continuing to build on its strong reputation for providing practical, hands-on training in the bioinformatic, statistical, and genetic epidemiological analysis of infectious disease data. Participants gained essential skills in genome assembly, variant detection, transcriptomics, proteomics, and phylogenetic analysis, using real-world examples to explore complex host-pathogen interactions and antimicrobial resistance within a systems biology framework.
