Wellbeing is fundamental to our health and overall happiness.

Having a strong and well-adapted sense of wellbeing can help us overcome difficulties and help us achieve our goals in life.

Work can become stressful at times so it is important to be able to take a break and relax with other members of your team that are in a similar boat, therefore, the first monthly Wellbeing day was born. Created by Matt Higgins and championed by Dan Ward, the team gathers together every last friday of the month to take their minds of upcoming Vivas and messy data and relax with a nice meal out for lunch before coming back to the grind.

Ofcourse we all enjoy our work but it is nice once a month to take a break and this month we would like to thank Pheonix Palace for accomodating us with great food and we look forward to the next wellbeing day next month now we are all rested.
