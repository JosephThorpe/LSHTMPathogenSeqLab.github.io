As we say goodbye to Dan, it’s a good time to think about the amazing work he’s done for us. Dan has been really important in our team, especially for his work with MinION long-read technology and the advanced systems he helped set up. His leaving is not just about him moving on, but also a chance for us to remember how special his skills and personality have been.

Dan’s technical proficiency, especially in the realm of MinION long-read technology, has been nothing short of transformative. Under his guidance, our team mastered the intricacies of this advanced technology, and his knack for simplifying complex concepts made the learning process both accessible and engaging.

Dan's role in our team was multifaceted, extending far beyond his technical prowess. Not only was he an expert in handling the complexities of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), but he was also a guiding force for all new team members. His approachable demeanour and readiness to share his expertise made it easier for newcomers to adapt and grasp the intricacies of ONT tech. Dan was always there, offering support and guidance, ensuring a smoother transition for everyone joining the team.

On a personal note, I experienced Dan's supportive nature first-hand on my very first day. Coming in with the usual mix of excitement and nerves that accompany any new job, I found Dan to be an invaluable help in getting settled. His assistance during those initial hours was more than just about work; he made me feel welcomed and a part of the team. This experience highlighted how Dan's contributions went beyond his technical knowledge. His friendly and supportive approach not only helped in easing my own transition into the team but also exemplified his integral role in making the workplace a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all new members.

What we’ll probably miss most about Dan is his sense of humour. His jokes were often a bit silly, but they made us laugh because they were so unexpected. His fun and playful nature made our office a nicer place to work, adding a feeling of friendship and happiness. His jokes made busy days feel a bit easier.

As Dan starts his new adventure, we really want to thank him for everything he’s done, for helping us, and for the happy atmosphere he brought to our team. We’re excited to see him start his next job and we’re sure he’ll do really well there.

Goodbye, Dan! We’re going to miss you a lot, but what you’ve done here, the partnerships you’ve helped with, and the fun we’ve had will stay with us. We wish you the best in your new job and hope you enjoy it as much as you’ve made our time enjoyable here.
