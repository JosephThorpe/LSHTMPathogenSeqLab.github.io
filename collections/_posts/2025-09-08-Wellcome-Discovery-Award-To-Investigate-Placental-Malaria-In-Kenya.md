Each year, an estimated 10,000 women die and 200,000 babies are stillborn due to pregnancy complications caused by malaria, with 95% of cases occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Through a new five-year Wellcome Discovery Award, we will work with Mount Kenya University (lead institution), the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (Berlin), and the University of Cambridge to apply advanced omics and artificial intelligence approaches to uncover how malaria affects placental biology and pregnancy outcomes.
