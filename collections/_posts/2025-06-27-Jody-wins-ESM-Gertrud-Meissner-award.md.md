Jody Phelan has been awarded the prestigious ESM Gertrud Meissner Award for 2025, which recognises outstanding early-career scientists under the age of 40 making significant contributions to the field of mycobacteriology. This annual award honours innovative research across areas such as diagnostics, resistance mechanisms, molecular epidemiology, population genetics, and host-pathogen interactions. Named in memory of Gertrud Meissner, a pioneering figure who laid the foundation for modern drug susceptibility testing and resistance studies, the award celebrates her legacy of building a strong mycobacteriology research community in Europe. As part of the award, Jody will present his work at the annual ESM congress.
