A project funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and carried out by Matt and Emma with members at the ICDDRB institute in Dhaka has reported promising initial results. The pioneering molecular xeno-monitoring and insecticide screening project has made important strides in tracking diseases like Plasmodium, Dengue, Wuchereria Bancrofti, and Leish.

Matt and Emma have also asked to give special recognition to Prakash Josh, Arko Chowdhury, and Nishad for their unwavering support and significant contribution to the project. The host team has played an indispensable role in this pioneering project's initial success.

The project has successfully detected Dengue-positive Aedes mosquitoes through xeno-monitoring and potentially found some Plasmodium positive samples as well. These encouraging results not only advance our understanding of these diseases but also demonstrate the effectiveness of xeno-monitoring as a viable disease surveillance method.

As the research continues, the team remains optimistic about the potential for xeno-monitoring to revolutionize disease control and prevention. This project marks a significant step forward in the continuous battle against infectious diseases, especially in regions where these diseases are most prevalent.

This early success story in Dhaka gives hope to scientists and researchers worldwide that, with continued research and development, xeno-monitoring could become a standard tool for disease surveillance and control in the near future.

For now, the team will continue to work together and further analyse the results and we welcome back Emma and Matt to London.
