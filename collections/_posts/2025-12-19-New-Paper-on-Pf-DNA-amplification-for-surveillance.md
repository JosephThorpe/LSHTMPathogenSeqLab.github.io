Genomics is central to malaria control, enabling population-level surveillance and detection of antimalarial drug resistance, yet sequencing low-density and asymptomatic infections remains challenging due to limited parasite DNA. Here, we optimised selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) for <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> clinical samples by evaluating shorter incubation times and a next-generation phi29 polymerase to enhance efficiency and clinical applicability. Drug resistance profiles were highly consistent across all samples and experimental conditions, demonstrating the robustness of the optimised protocol. This streamlined approach supports faster, more cost-effective genomic surveillance suitable for routine clinical and public health use.
