Jody joined the team in 2014 as a PhD student and was one of the original members of the group. After 12 years with us, he’s decided it’s time for a new adventure. Over the years, Jody has produced an incredible amount of high-quality research, including tools like malaria-profiler and tb-profiler, which are now used by research teams all over the world.

Within the School, Jody has been involved in just about everything. If there was bioinformatics to be done, a pipeline to fix, or some mysterious IT problem no one else could solve, Jody was always the go-to person. Chances are, if it needed doing, Jody had already done it, or knew exactly how to.

More than anything though, we’ll miss Jody as a colleague and a friend. He’s kind, approachable, endlessly helpful, and one of the best people you could hope to work with. The team won’t be the same without him. We’re sad to see him go, and jealous of whoever’s gained him, but we wish him all the very best,and he’s always welcome back.
