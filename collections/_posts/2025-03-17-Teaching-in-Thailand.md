The team recently travelled to Thailand to deliver the ‘Omics’ course at the Princess Srisavangavadhana College of Medicine, bringing cutting-edge knowledge and hands-on training in genomic technologies to a new cohort of students and professionals.

Infectious diseases such as HIV-AIDS, malaria, pneumonia, and tuberculosis remain some of the leading causes of mortality worldwide — accounting for 25% of global deaths and over half of all deaths in children under five. Understanding the genetic and molecular underpinnings of these diseases is essential, yet complex, often involving multiple genomes: the human host, the pathogen(s), and in some cases, a vector.

This course explored these complexities through a systems biology lens, moving beyond the genome to integrate the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies, researchers are now able to dissect these layers at unprecedented resolution. For example, genome-wide association studies using SNP chips have transformed our understanding of human susceptibility to disease, while whole genome sequencing of pathogens allows for real-time tracking of microbial evolution and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

Students were trained in analysing RNA-seq data to study transcript abundance and differential gene expression, gaining insights into both human and pathogen biology. Throughout the course, the emphasis was on hands-on learning, with the majority of sessions held in computer labs where participants worked directly with sequencing data — from genome assembly and variant identification, to phylogenetic analysis and proteomic profiling.

Using real-world case studies like malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and MRSA, participants engaged with tools and methods that are directly applicable to ongoing public health challenges. The course not only built technical skills but also fostered interdisciplinary thinking at the intersection of bioinformatics, population genetics, and statistics.

Delivering this course in Thailand reflects a commitment to building local capacity and supporting regional expertise in infectious disease genomics. The enthusiasm and engagement of the participants highlighted the growing interest in ‘omics sciences and their vital role in tackling global health issues.
