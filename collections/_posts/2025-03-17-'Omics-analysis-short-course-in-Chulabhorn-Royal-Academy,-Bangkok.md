Members of the LSHTM team recently travelled to Thailand to deliver a four-day ‘Omics’ training course at the Princess Srisavangavadhana College of Medicine, Chulabhorn Royal Academy. Co-organised by Dr Woranich Hinthong, the course was attended by over 50 researchers working in academic and public health institutions across Bangkok. Supported by UKRI-EPSRC funding, the programme covered both the generation and analysis of ‘omics data, including hands-on sessions using the Oxford Nanopore sequencing platform.
