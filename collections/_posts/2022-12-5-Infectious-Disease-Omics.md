Our Infectious Disease ‘omics course was hosted by the RVC, with many participants online. The Alan Turing Institute sponsored RVC places on the course. Specifically, this course offers hands-on experience of processing sequencing data to construct genomes, identifying genomic variants and applying downstream methods, such as phylogenetics. Further, the course covers transcriptomic and proteomic analysis in human and pathogen settings. High profile examples, including malaria, TB and MRSA, will be used to illustrate the concepts, and there is a strong emphasis on how to implement the methods in practice, with the majority of sessions computer-based.
