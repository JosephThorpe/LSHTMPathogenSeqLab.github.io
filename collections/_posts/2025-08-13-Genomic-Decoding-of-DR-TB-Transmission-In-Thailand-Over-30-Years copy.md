brief: WGS analysis of 2,005 M. tuberculosis isolates from Thailand (1994–2020) revealed extensive MDR-TB transmission, with 206 clades, underscoring WGS’s value for tracking resistance and guiding TB control.

Thailand carries a high burden of tuberculosis (TB), including widespread circulation of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains. We analysed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 2,005 Mtb isolates collected across Thailand between 1994 and 2020, of which 67.3% were classified as multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Clustering analysis revealed 206 transmission clades (maximum size: 288 isolates), predominantly involving MDR-TB, particularly in the Central and Northeastern regions. These findings highlight the power of WGS to elucidate TB transmission dynamics and drug-resistance patterns, providing essential data to guide more effective control strategies in Thailand and beyond.
