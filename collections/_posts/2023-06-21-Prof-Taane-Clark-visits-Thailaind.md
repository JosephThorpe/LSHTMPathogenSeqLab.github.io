In early May, our the school was visited by a senior delegation from the Department of Medical Sciences, Thailand Ministry of Public Health, to discuss joint genomics projects in TB and AMR infections, and capacity strengthening programs.

The delegation included Dr. Supakit Sirilak (Director General) and Dr. Surakameth Mahasirimongkol. (Director, Medical Life Sciences Institute) (see photo).

In a reciprocated visit, Taane Clark presented a keynote address on infectious disease genomics at the annual Thailand Ministry of Public Health conference in Bangkok (June 21-22, 2023).

This included showcasing all of the infectious disease work our team has been working on over the last year with a great reciprocative audience. We hope this partnership continues in striving forward.
