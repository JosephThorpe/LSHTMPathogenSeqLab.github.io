brief: We co-organised an Infectious disease ‘omics symposium and data analysis workshop in the National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology and Entomology (NIMPE, Ministry of Health), Hanoi, Vietnam. Participants came from around Vietnam, and included staff within the national malaria control programme, who are starting to apply sequencing-based technologies to inform surveillance activities. The meeting was part funded by an MRC grant.
