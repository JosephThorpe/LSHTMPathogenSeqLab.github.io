As part of a joint 3-year UKRI-FAPESP project with collaborators at the Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas, University of São Paulo, we will support the generation of whole genome sequence data for Plasmodium falciparum and <i>P. vivax</i> from remote regions of Brazil. We will also develop informatics tools to aid clinical decision-making and malaria surveillance efforts.
