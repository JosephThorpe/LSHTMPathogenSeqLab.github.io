brief:  Human genome-wide association studies have failed so far to reveal reproducible susceptibility loci, attributed in part to the influence of the underlying <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> bacterial genotype on the outcome of the infection. In recent work by Jody et al, by implementing a phylogenetic tree-based analysis for 714 TB patients from Thailand, we identify eight putative genetic interaction points both linked to the IFNγ cytokine and host immune system. The genome-to-genome analysis reveals a complex interactome picture, supports host-pathogen adaptation and co-evolution in TB, and has potential applications to large-scale studies across many TB endemic populations
