Malaria remains a major global health burden. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) is a key indicator of transmission intensity. Traditional PCR-based methods often underestimate MOI, while existing genomic metrics are limited by weak correlation with true MOI or high computational cost. We present Malaria-MOI, a flexible tool that efficiently estimates clone number from both short- and long-read sequencing data and integrates easily into genome-based profiling and command-line pipelines. Evaluated on >8,000 <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> isolates from 28 countries, Malaria-MOI achieves high accuracy using 165 loci, produces results consistent with known transmission patterns, and has potential applications beyond malaria.
