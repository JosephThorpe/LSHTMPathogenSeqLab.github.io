brief:  Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) Gram-negative bacteria cause nosocomial infections and rapidly acquire antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which makes it a global threat to human health. It also has a comparatively rare hypervirulent phenotype that can lead to severe disease in otherwise healthy individuals. Unlike classic Kp, canonical hypervirulent strains usually have limited AMR. However, after initial case reports in 2015, carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Kp has increased in prevalence, including in China, but there is limited understanding of its burden in other geographical regions.
