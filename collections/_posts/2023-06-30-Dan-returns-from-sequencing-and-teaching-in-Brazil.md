After a significant expedition spanning across various parts of Brazil, our team member Dr. Dan Ward has returned. The trip's central mission was to strengthen capacity in nanopore sequencing and enhance our understanding of plasmodium surveillance in the context of illegal gold mining regions.

During his expedition, Dr. Ward worked closely with local teams, his main role was to do capacity strengthening for nanopore sequencing and training them in its utilization. His focus was not only to develop technical proficiency but also to instill an understanding of the wider context and implications of the technology.

A significant part of his work involved plasmodium surveillance. Plasmodium parasites are the cause of malaria, a disease that continues to afflict many regions around the world, especially in less developed countries. The illegal gold mining areas of Brazil are particularly susceptible due to the conditions that favor the breeding of Anopheles mosquitoes, the vectors of these parasites.

Due to the lack of proper healthcare in these regions and the mistrust of doctors, Dr. Ward's research aimed at detecting abuse of antimalarial drugs and investigating potential drug resistance in these regions. He managed to sequence 50 whole-genome sequences (WGS) of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum from dried blood spots, contributing significant data to our understanding of these pathogens. In addition, he conducted amplicon sequencing for Anopheles mosquitoes, enabling a deeper understanding of the vectors themselves.

Besides the technical and scientific aspects of his journey, Dr. Ward also focused on information campaigning and public engagement. Recognizing the importance of community involvement and understanding in disease control, he initiated dialogues with locals, educating them about malaria, its risks, and prevention methods. He conveyed the significance of the abuse and resistance of antimalarial drugs and the potential dangers that could unfold if left unchecked.

This expedition is expected to contribute substantially to the ongoing battle against malaria. By enhancing nanopore sequencing skills in Brazil, Dr. Ward has helped ensure the country is better equipped to handle the threat of drug-resistant malaria. Furthermore, his work has highlighted the importance of continued surveillance in high-risk areas and public engagement in managing and preventing disease.

In the fight against global diseases, it is not just about developing advanced technologies but also ensuring they reach the places they are most needed. Through his expedition, Dr. Dan Ward has shown how scientists can take a more proactive role in this process, leaving a lasting impact not only through their research but also through their direct actions on the ground.
