The annual Vector-Borne Diseases (VBD) Conference, a premier gathering of researchers from across the UK, once again showcased groundbreaking work in vector research and the diseases they transmit. Among this year’s highlights were the presentations by Prof. Susana Campino and Dr. Nina Billows, whose contributions underscored the importance of innovation and collaboration in tackling the challenges posed by vectors such as ticks and mosquitoes.

Dr. Nina Billows presented her pioneering work on building a reference genome for ticks. As tick-borne diseases continue to emerge as a significant public health threat, her efforts aim to provide a critical tool for understanding tick genetics and their role in pathogen transmission. Her research lays the groundwork for new interventions that can mitigate the impact of tick-borne diseases.

Meanwhile, Prof. Susana Campino was invited to join an expert panel to discuss the future of vector research. The discussion delved into pressing issues and emerging opportunities for advancing the field, from leveraging genomic tools to developing sustainable control measures. Prof. Campino also highlighted her ongoing work with ticks, emphasising the importance of multidisciplinary approaches to address the complexities of vector ecology and disease transmission.

The UK VBD Conference continues to serve as a platform for fostering dialogue and collaboration among researchers. With presentations like those of Prof. Campino and Dr. Billows, the event exemplifies the commitment of the UK’s scientific community to combating vector-borne diseases and shaping the future of vector research.
