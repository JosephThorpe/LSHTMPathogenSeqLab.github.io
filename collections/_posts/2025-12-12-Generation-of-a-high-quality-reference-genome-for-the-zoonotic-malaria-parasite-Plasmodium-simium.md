 Zoonotic malaria caused by <i>Plasmodium simium</i> complicates control efforts due to hidden animal reservoirs and altered transmission dynamics, as highlighted by recent outbreaks in Brazil. High-quality genomic resources are essential to identify host-adaptation markers and improve diagnostics, prompting the generation of a new <i>P. simium reference genome</i> (Ps_SãoPaulo, 21.8 Mb) using Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing. Comparative analyses confirmed key differences from <i>P. vivax</i>, including mitochondrial mutations, deletions in invasion genes, and variation in blood-stage antigens. Genome-wide analysis of Brazilian isolates revealed divergence from <i>P. vivax</i> and signatures of selection, providing critical insights for zoonotic malaria surveillance and control.
