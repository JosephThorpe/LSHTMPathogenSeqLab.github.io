The citation referred to Taane having advanced the understanding of how genetic factors influence diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. It also referred to the groups use of advanced sequencing and analytical approaches, to develop tools that

enhance disease surveillance and inform clinical decision-making, training up a large global cohort of exceptional young scientists in these techniques along the way.

The awards ceremony was held at the RSTMH annual meeting in London. Professor Daniel Chandramohan, also at the LSHTM, won the Sir Rickard Christophers Medal, and Professor Jimmy Whitworth (RSHTM President) presented the awards (see picture).
