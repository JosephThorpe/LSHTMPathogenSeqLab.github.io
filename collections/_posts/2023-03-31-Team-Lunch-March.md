brief:  In March, our team lunch event was at Siam Central. Our third lunch event of the year was a resounding success, with everyone who attended enjoying the great food and even better company. We were able to connect with colleagues we have not seen in person for a while, as well as get to know some of the newer team members better. The best part was that we all agreed to strictly no work talk, which allowed us to focus on building relationships and having fun.
