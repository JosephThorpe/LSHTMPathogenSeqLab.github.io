brief:  Following up on my previous article about team cohesion, I am excited to report on our recent team lunch event at Siam Central. Since we last met up, our team has faced some new challenges due to ongoing technical issues and other technicalities, as well as working from home and dealing with new team members without the same integration options as before. To combat this, we decided to organize a monthly team lunch where we can all get together and catch up in a relaxed and informal setting.

Following up on my previous article about team cohesion, I am excited to report on our recent team lunch event at Siam Central. Since we last met up, our team has faced some new challenges due to ongoing technical issues and other technicalities, as well as working from home and dealing with new team members without the same integration options as before. To combat this, we decided to organize a monthly team lunch where we can all get together and catch up in a relaxed and informal setting.

Our third lunch event was a resounding success, with everyone who attended enjoying the great food and even better company. We were able to connect with colleagues we haven't seen in person for a while, as well as get to know some of the newer team members better. The best part was that we all agreed to strictly no work talk, which allowed us to focus on building relationships and having fun.

I'm happy to report that we have already planned our next team lunch event for next month, and we're excited to see even more of our team members come out to join us. We're also grateful to Siam Central for accommodating us with their delicious food and excellent service.

In conclusion, team cohesion is a critical component of success in any workplace. By taking the time to connect with colleagues in a relaxed setting, we can strengthen our relationships, boost morale, and increase productivity. I encourage all teams to prioritize team cohesion, even if it's just a monthly lunch event like ours. It's a small investment that can pay huge dividends in the long run.
