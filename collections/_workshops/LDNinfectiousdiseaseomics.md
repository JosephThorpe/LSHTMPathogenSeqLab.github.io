Beginning in 2017 and ongoing, the Pathogen Seq Lab team in London has been providing a pioneering and comprehensive workshop called "Infectious Disease ‘omics". Held every December, this workshop aims to educate and foster an understanding of the role and potential of ‘omics technologies in the field of infectious diseases. To take full advantage of new ‘omic technologies requires the ability to analyse large amounts of data using methods from bioinformatics, population genetics and statistics – the focus of this course. Specifically, this course offers hands-on experience of processing sequencing data to construct genomes, identifying genomic variants and applying downstream methods, such as phylogenetics. Further, the course covers transcriptomic and proteomic analysis in human and pathogen settings. High profile examples, including malaria, TB and MRSA, will be used to illustrate the concepts, and there is a strong emphasis on how to implement the methods in practice, with the majority of sessions computer-based.
