 This five-day Workshop will be held in October, aimed at early career researchers from the UK and Malaysia. This Workshop will bring together global experts on the study of genomic epidemiology of infectious diseases, particularly those affecting Malaysia. The Workshops aims to promote collaborations that will enhance the use of tools in bioinformatics, population genetics and statistics in infectious disease research. Day one and five of the Workshop, will focus on presentations and discussions relating to the role of genomics in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, with a focus on Malaysia. The other days, which will be held at the Computational Science and Research Centre, will focus on genomic analyses. By the end of the Workshop, participants will be able to: (a) process raw sequence into a set of informative variants, through mapping to a reference genome or using de novo or reference-free assembly approaches, (b) conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analysis, in an integrated systems biology approach, and (c) perform downstream population genetic and association analysis.
