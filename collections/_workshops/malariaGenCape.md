To stop malaria — a disease which affects millions of people every year — we must understand it better. MalariaGEN is a data-sharing network of partners in 40+ countries who build and share large-scale human, malaria parasite, and mosquito data resources. We study malaria epidemiology and evolution to create accessible resources for malaria control. These datasets facilitate the search for new drugs, insecticides, and vaccines. They also contribute to genomic surveillance tools that help control and eliminate malaria.
