The "Genomics of Complex Diseases" workshop took place in October 2018 at Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang, an institution known for its commitment to advancing knowledge and learning through quality research and education. Supported by the British Council and the Akademi Sains through Newton-Ungku Omar Researcher Links Workshop Grants, the workshop brought together 60 participants from diverse scientific backgrounds. Over five days, attendees engaged in intensive sessions focused on the challenges and opportunities in the field of complex disease genomics. The workshop not only fostered a deep understanding of genomic strategies in studying complex diseases, but also facilitated networking and collaboration among researchers. This event contributed significantly to the growing momentum in genomics research in the region.
