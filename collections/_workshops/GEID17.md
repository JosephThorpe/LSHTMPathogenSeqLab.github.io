To take full advantage of new ‘omic technologies requires the ability to analyse large amounts of data using methods from bioinformatics, population genetics and statistics – the focus of this Workshop. Specifically, the Workshop offers hands-on experience of processing sequencing data to construct genomes, identifying genomic variants and applying downstream methods, such as phylogenetics. Further, the course covers transcriptomic and proteomic analysis in human and pathogen settings. High profile examples, including malaria, TB and MRSA, will be used to illustrate the concepts, and there is a strong emphasis on how to implement the methods in practice, with the majority of sessions computer-based.
