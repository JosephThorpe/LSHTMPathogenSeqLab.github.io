In March 2017, we hosted a dynamic and focused "Pathogen Genomics" workshop in the beautiful city of Cape Town. This workshop, funded by Newton Fund and industry sponsors, was an intensive, hands-on exploration of how genomics can aid in understanding and combating infectious diseases. The workshop saw a cohort of 15 dedicated participants from diverse backgrounds come together. The small group size allowed for personalized attention and in-depth discussions, fostering a rich learning environment.
