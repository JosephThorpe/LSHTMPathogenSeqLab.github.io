Members of our team (Jody, Linfeng, Matt) ran a bioinformatic analysis clinic at the Research Institute for tropical Medicine, Department of Health in the Philippines, with whom we have collaborated since 2016 on infectious disease genomics and had continuous joint (UKRI) funding. The aim of the clinic was to provide training to biomedical researchers and technicians in the use of bioinformatic tools and techniques for the analysis of genomic data, as well as directly assist them with analysis. Over two days, the team assisted with AMR, COVID-19, malaria, TB, and Schistosoma genomic, transcriptomics and serological data analysis.
