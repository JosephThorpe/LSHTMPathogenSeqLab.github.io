In February 2016, we had the opportunity to conduct an illuminating and highly successful workshop titled "Genomics of Infectious Diseases" in the bustling city of Bangkok, Thailand. This event was graciously hosted at the prestigious Mahidol-Siriraj facility, and its organization was made possible through the generous support of the British Council and the Thai Research Fund. This workshop turned out to be an intensive learning experience, bringing together as many as 150 participants. The audience comprised a diverse group of learners - researchers, academicians, healthcare professionals, and students - all coming together with the shared objective to deepen their understanding of genomics and its crucial role in combating infectious diseases.
