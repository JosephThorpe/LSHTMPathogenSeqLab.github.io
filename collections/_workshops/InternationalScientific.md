Working in partnership is central to achieving our mission to improve health and health equity in the UK and worldwide. By collaborating with global partners we can bring the best people and knowledge together to achieve excellence in research, education, policy and practice. We have longstanding and extensive partnerships, especially in low and middle-income countries, and are continually looking to build on our relationships and activities to both learn from and empower our colleagues and partners throughout the world.
