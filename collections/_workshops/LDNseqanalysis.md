The Pathogen Seq Lab team, known for their expertise and innovation in sequencing technologies, conducted an enriching short course spanning five years at the esteemed London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Taking place each September from 2010 to 2015, the course was designed to shed light on the application and interpretation of high-throughput sequencing data in the field of public health. Focusing primarily on epidemiological investigations and outbreak response, this course offered practical knowledge in the rapidly advancing field of pathogen genomics. The attendees learned the essential tools and methodologies required for analyzing sequencing data, including assembly, annotation, and comparative genomics. Besides, the course facilitated an understanding of the challenges associated with high-throughput sequencing and how to overcome them.
