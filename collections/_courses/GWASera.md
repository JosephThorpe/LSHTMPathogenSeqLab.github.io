Genetic epidemiology holds great potential for personalised medicine and improved biological knowledge of disease processes. This course provides an introduction to the design, analysis and interpretation of genetic studies of disease, with a focus on state of the art analysis of genomewide association scans. The course is 4 days long. On days 1 and 2 basic, basic genetics will be introduced and relevant statistical methods for linkage and association analysis will be described. Days 3 and 4 will cover the design and analysis of genomewide association scans, including emerging applications to risk prediction and biological pathway analysis. Throughout the course participants will gain practical experience of analysing genetic data in population and family studies. By the end of the course participants will have an understanding of the fundamental concepts of genetic epidemiology, will have a working knowledge of the terminology and current status of the field, and will be able to perform many basic analyses of genetic data. This course is followed by the companion course “High throughput sequencing in disease studies”
