We have established a network (V-CAMPAIGN) to introduce genomic technologies that will allow the developing an understanding of how mosquito control initiatives and patient therapies affect genetic diversity in both the vectors and pathogens; and their consequent impact. This goal will be achieved by integrating sequencing and genotyping of mosquito samples (including their pathogens) from Asia (Malaysia and Philippines), Africa (Kenya, Malawi and Cabo Verde) and South America (Brazil), and analyzing the resulting genetic data with epidemiological meta data (e.g. vector control measures, geographical location, species, mosquito abundance, insecticide use) together.
