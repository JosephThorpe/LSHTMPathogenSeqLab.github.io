Zika virus infection is a mosquito-borne disease, caused by a virus from the Flavivirus genus, first detected in Uganda in 1947. Before 2007, viral circulation causing mild clinical symptoms was documented in tropical Africa and in some areas in Asia. Since 2007, several islands of the Pacific region have experienced outbreaks and in 2015, outbreaks were reported for the first time in South America. Recent outbreaks have been linked to an increase in neurological syndromes and in Brazil was associated with a sudden spike of congenital microcephaly cases. Cabo Verde was the first African country declaring an epidemic of Zika. To determine the origin and spread of infection and support the implementation of a rapid response and control measurements we performed a surveillance study of the Zika virus in Cape Verde. This project has a multidisciplinary approach; viro-entomo-epidemio-genomics working together to support investigation of the Zika virus infection epidemic. The work is in partnership with the Jean Piaget University and Cabo Verde Ministry of Health. We are currently finalising analyses of Zika genome sequences, Aedes and Culex genetics and host sera, as well as the roll-out of informatics tools for sample collection.
