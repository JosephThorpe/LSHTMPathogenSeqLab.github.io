Plasmodium knowlesi, a common malaria parasite of long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, is now recognized as a significant cause of human malaria, accounting for up to 70% of malaria cases in certain areas in Southeast Asia including Malaysian Borneo. Rapid human population growth, deforestation and encroachment on wild macaque habitats potentially increase contact with humans and drive up the prevalence of human Plasmodium knowlesi infections. Appropriate molecular tools and sampling are needed to assist surveillance by malaria control programmes, and to understand the genetics underpinning Plasmodium knowlesi transmission and switching of hosts from macaques to humans. Using a new reference genome [1], our work [2] presents a comprehensive analysis of the largest assembled set of Plasmodium knowlesi genome sequences from Malaysia. It reveals genetic regions that have been recently exchanged between long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, which contain genes with signals indicative of rapid contemporary ecological change, including deforestation. Additional analyses partition Plasmodium knowlesi infections in Borneo into 3 deeply branched lineages of ancient origin, which founded the two divergent populations associated with long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques and a third, highly diverse population, on the Peninsular mainland. Overall, the complex Plasmodium parasite evolution observed and likelihood of further host transitions are potential challenges to malaria control in Malaysia
