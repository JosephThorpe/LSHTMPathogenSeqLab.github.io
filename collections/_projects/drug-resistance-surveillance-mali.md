Sequence analysis of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites is informative in ensuring sustained success of malaria control programmes. Whole-genome sequencing technologies provide insights into the epidemiology and genome-wide variation of <i>P. falciparum</i> populations and can characterise geographical as well as temporal changes. This is particularly important to monitor the emergence and spread of drug resistant <i>P. falciparum</i> parasites which is threatening malaria control programmes world-wide. Here, we provide a detailed characterisation of genome-wide genetic variation and drug resistance profiles in asymptomatic individuals in South-Western Mali, where malaria transmission is intense and seasonal, and case numbers have recently increased. Samples collected from Ouélessébougou, Mali (2019–2020; n = 87) were sequenced and placed in the context of older Malian (2007–2017; n = 876) and African-wide (n = 711) <i>P. falciparum</i> isolates. Our analysis revealed high multiclonality and low relatedness between isolates, in addition to increased frequencies of molecular markers for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and lumefantrine resistance, compared to older Malian isolates. Furthermore, 21 genes under selective pressure were identified, including a transmission-blocking vaccine candidate (<i>pfCelTOS</i>) and an erythrocyte invasion locus (<i>pfdblmsp2</i>). Overall, our work provides the most recent assessment of <i>P. falciparum</i> genetic diversity in Mali, a country with the second highest burden of malaria in West Africa, thereby informing malaria control activities.
