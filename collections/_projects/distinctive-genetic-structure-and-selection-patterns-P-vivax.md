Despite the high burden of <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria in South Asian countries, the genetic diversity of circulating parasite populations is not well described. Determinants of antimalarial drug susceptibility for <i>P. vivax</i> in the region have not been characterised. Our genomic analysis of global <i>P. vivax</i> (n = 558) establishes South Asian isolates (n = 92) as a distinct subpopulation, which shares ancestry with some East African and South East Asian parasites. Signals of positive selection are linked to drug resistance-associated loci including <i>pvkelch10, pvmrp1, pvdhfr</i> and <i>pvdhps</i>, and two loci linked to <i>P. vivax</i> invasion of reticulocytes, <i>pvrbp1a</i> and <i>pvrbp1b</i>. Significant identity-by-descent was found in extended chromosome regions common to <i>P. vivax</i> from India and Ethiopia, including the <i>pvdbp</i> gene associated with Duffy blood group binding. Our investigation provides new understanding of global <i>P. vivax</i> population structure and genomic diversity, and genetic evidence of recent directional selection in this important human pathogen.
