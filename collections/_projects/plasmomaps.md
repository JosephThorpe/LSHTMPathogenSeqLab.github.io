PlasmoMaps is a web-based tool that can be used to explore genomic sequence data of the non-falciparum malaria parasites, including P. malariae (n>200; XX SNPs; X countries), P. vivax (n>800; XX SNPs), P. ovale (n>50; XX SNPs), and P. knowlesi (n>200; XX SNPs). The tool integrates the presentation and summarisation (e.g., allele frequencies) of genomic variants with geographical location on maps, along with viewing extra variant information provided in the integrated genomics viewer (IGV). The tool comes with 2 separate maps to either search genomic variants via chromosome or via a selected gene.
