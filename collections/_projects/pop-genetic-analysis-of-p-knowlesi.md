The zoonotic <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> parasite is a growing public health concern in Southeast Asia, especially in Malaysia, where elimination of <i>P. falciparum</i> and <i>P. vivax</i> malaria has been the focus of control efforts. Understanding of the genetic diversity of <i>P. knowlesi</i> parasites can provide insights into its evolution, population structure, diagnostics, transmission dynamics, and the emergence of drug resistance. Previous work has revealed that <i>P. knowlesi</i> fall into three main sub-populations distinguished by a combination of geographical location and macaque host (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i> and <i>M. nemestrina</i>). It has been shown that Malaysian Borneo groups display profound heterogeneity with long regions of high or low divergence resulting in mosaic patterns between sub-populations, with some evidence of chromosomal-segment exchanges. However, the genetic structure of non-Borneo sub-populations is less clear. By gathering one of the largest collections of <i>P. knowlesi</i> whole-genome sequencing data, we studied structural genomic changes across sub-populations, with the analysis revealing differences in Borneo clusters linked to mosquito-related stages of the parasite cycle, in contrast to differences in host-related stages for the Peninsular group. Our work identifies new genetic exchange events, including introgressions between Malaysian Peninsular and <i>M. nemestrina</i>-associated clusters on various chromosomes, including in parasite invasion genes (<i>DBPβ</i>, <i>NBPXα</i> and <i>NBPXβ</i>), and important proteins expressed in the vertebrate parasite stages. Recombination events appear to have occurred between the Peninsular and <i>M. fascicularis</i>-associated groups, including in the <i>DBPβ</i> and <i>DBPγ</i> invasion associated genes. Overall, our work finds that genetic exchange events have occurred among the recognised contemporary groups of <i>P. knowlesi</i> parasites during their evolutionary history, leading to apparent mosaicism between these sub-populations. These findings generate new hypotheses relevant to parasite evolutionary biology and <i>P. knowlesi</i> epidemiology, which can inform malaria control approaches to containing the impact of zoonotic malaria on human communities.
