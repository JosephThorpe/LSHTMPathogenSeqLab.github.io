This project will assist TB researchers worldwide by sequencing the genome of strains held in the UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Planning Agency for Tropical Disease Research and Training (TDR) TB Strain Bank. The Strain Bank is a collection of well characterized strains of M tuberculosis that are available to the TB research community. It is a high quality bioresource for basic science, supporting the development of new diagnostics and drug-resistant detection tools and providing reference materials for laboratory quality management programmes. It comprises clinical M tuberculosis isolates that are available as quality controlled freeze-dried, viable strains or as heat-inactivated bacterial suspensions. Isolates originate from diverse geographical settings and were selected for their resistance profiles against first- and second-line drugs. The collection is held and managed by within the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp.
