We identified and analysed 3034 unique plasmid replicons to inform the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (Kp) (n=1028, 7.8%). We found several outbreaks globally, including one involving ST11 strains in China and another of ST231 in Asia centred on India, Thailand, and Pakistan. There was evidence of global flow of Kp, including across multiple continents. In most cases, clusters of Kp isolates are the result of hypervirulence genes entering classic strains, instead of carbapenem resistance genes entering canonical hypervirulent onesg.
