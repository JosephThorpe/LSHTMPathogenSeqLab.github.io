Characterising the genomic variation and population dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in high transmission regions of Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial to the long-term efficacy of regional malaria elimination campaigns and eradication. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technologies can contribute towards understanding the epidemiology and structural variation landscape of P. falciparum populations, including those within the Lake Victoria basin, a region of intense transmission. Here we provide a baseline assessment of the genomic diversity of P. falciparum isolates in the Lake region of Kenya, which has sparse genetic data. Lake region isolates are placed within the context of African-wide populations using Illumina WGS data and population genomic analyses. Our analysis revealed that P. falciparum isolates from Lake Victoria form a cluster within the East African parasite population. These isolates also appear to have distinct ancestral origins, containing genome-wide signatures from both Central and East African lineages. Known drug resistance biomarkers were observed at similar frequencies to those of East African parasite populations, including the S160N/T mutation in the pfap2mu gene, which has been associated with delayed clearance by artemisinin-based combination therapy. Overall, our work provides a first assessment of P. falciparum genetic diversity within the Lake Victoria basin, a region targeting malaria elimination.
