In November 2015, cases of Zika virus infection were recorded in Cabo Verde (Africa), originating from Brazil. The outbreak subsided after seven months with 7580 suspected cases. We performed a serological survey (n = 431) in Praia, the capital city, 3 months after transmission ceased. Serum samples were screened for arbovirus antibodies using ELISA techniques and revealed seroconverted individuals with Zika (10.9%), dengue (1–4) (12.5%), yellow fever (0.2%) and chikungunya (2.6%) infections. Zika seropositivity was predominantly observed amongst females (70%). Using a logistic model, risk factors for increased odds of Zika seropositivity included age, self-reported Zika infection, and dengue seropositivity. Serological data from Zika and dengue virus assays were strongly correlated (Spearman’s rs = 0.80), which reduced when using a double antigen binding ELISA (Spearman’s rs = 0.54). Overall, our work improves an understanding of how Zika and other arboviruses have spread throughout the Cabo Verde population. It also demonstrates the utility of serological assay formats for outbreak investigations.
