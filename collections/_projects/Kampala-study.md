In collaboration with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Makerere University Medical School and the TB lab at the Joint Clinical Research Centre, Uganda we have analysed the genome of 51 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. The sample includes drug resistant strains and longitudinal samples from individual patients. They were collected during a project Strategies for the management of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Kampala, Uganda funded by the Wellcome Trust. It was a four year project and was a collaboration of scientists from Uganda, UK and USA.
