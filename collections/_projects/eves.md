<i>Aedes genera</i> mosquitos are the main vectors for Dengue, Zika and West Nile viral infections, which affect millions of people each year and have limited treatment options. Understanding how <i>Aedes</i> mosquitos tolerate high viral load may lead to better treatment methods and transmission blocking strategies. In particular, integrated viral sequences (“EVEs”) within vector genomes may give exploitable biological insights. Using a robust bioinformatic approach, 10,644 flavivirus genomes were BLAST matched against two genome assemblies of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and three assemblies of <i>Ae. albopictus</i>. We found that flaviviruses have integrated into <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and <i>Ae. albopictus</i> genomes no more than four and nine times respectively, almost an order of magnitude lower than previous reports. <i>Xishuangbanna aedes</i> and <i>Menghai aedes</i> like flaviviruses seem to have been integrated into <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, and the EVEs were confirmed as non-contaminants using long sequence read analysis. Whilst, Bangkok or Kamiti River like viruses seem to have integrated into the <i>Ae. albopictus</i> genome. The EVEs between the two Aedes species have little similarity, suggesting different evolutionary origins of integrations and potential differential viral tolerance between the vectors. Our analysis suggests the flaviviruses integrated as long sequences and were subsequently fragmented and shuffled by transposable elements. Overall, our re-evaluation of viral integration events will inform experiments that could provide new insights into the role of mosquito EVEs on viral tolerance, leading to disease control strategies.
