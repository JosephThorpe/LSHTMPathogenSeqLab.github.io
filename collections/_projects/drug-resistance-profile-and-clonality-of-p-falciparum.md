Polymorphisms in <i>pfk13</i> associated with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) tolerance in Southeast Asia were not detected, but the majority of the tested samples carried the <i>pfmdr1</i> haplotype NFD and anti-malarial-associated mutations in the the <i>pfcrt</i> and <i>pfdhfr</i> genes. The first whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed for Cape Verdean parasites that showed that the samples cluster together, have a very high level of similarity and are close to other parasites populations from West Africa.
