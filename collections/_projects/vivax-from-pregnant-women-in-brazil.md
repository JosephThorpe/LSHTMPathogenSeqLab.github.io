Initially, the pregnant women were stratified into two groups—1 recurrence and 2 or more recurrences—in which no differences were observed in clinical gestational outcomes or in placental histological changes between the two groups. Then we evaluated the parasites genetically. An average of 18.5 distinct alleles were found at each of the MS loci, and the HE calculated for each marker indicates a high genetic diversity occurring within the population. There was a high percentage of polyclonal infections (61.7%, 108/175), and one haplotype (H1) occurred frequently (20%), with only 9 of the haplotypes appearing in more than one patient
