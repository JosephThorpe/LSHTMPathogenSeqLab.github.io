We developed Malaria-GENOMAP, a user-friendly, web-based visualisation tool that integrates genomic variant data - including allele frequencies - with interactive geographical maps and multi-scale views spanning whole chromosomes to individual genes. The platform incorporates genomic variation from <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i>, <i>P. malariae</i>, <i>P. ovale curtisi</i>, <i>P. ovale wallikeri</i>, <i>P. simium</i>, and <i>P. vivax</i>. Malaria-GENOMAP enables detailed investigation of population structure, geographic patterns of genetic variation, and putative drug-resistance markers, providing valuable insights to support malaria surveillance and control efforts.
