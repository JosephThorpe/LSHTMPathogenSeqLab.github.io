Characterising the genomic variation and population dynamics of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites in high transmission regions of Sub-Saharan Africa is crucial to the long-term efficacy of regional malaria elimination campaigns and eradication. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technologies can contribute towards understanding the epidemiology and structural variation landscape of <i>P. falciparum</i> populations, including those within the Lake Victoria basin, a region of intense transmission. Here we provide a baseline assessment of the genomic diversity of <i>P. falciparum</i> isolates in the Lake region of Kenya, which has sparse genetic data. Lake region isolates are placed within the context of African-wide populations using Illumina WGS data and population genomic analyses. Our analysis revealed that <i>P. falciparum</i> isolates from Lake Victoria form a cluster within the East African parasite population. These isolates also appear to have distinct ancestral origins, containing genome-wide signatures from both Central and East African lineages. Known drug resistance biomarkers were observed at similar frequencies to those of East African parasite populations, including the S160N/T mutation in the <i>pfap2mu</i> gene, which has been associated with delayed clearance by artemisinin-based combination therapy. Overall, our work provides a first assessment of<i> P. falciparum</i> genetic diversity within the Lake Victoria basin, a region targeting malaria elimination.
