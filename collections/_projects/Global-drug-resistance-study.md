This study is an academic collaboration, bringing together expertise and knowledge from 18 laboratories around the world to form a GDRS partnership. The study is coordinated by Taane Clark at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). The GDRS is whole genome sequencing and analysing the sequence and drug susceptibility testing data from a large collection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Sequencing of the first 1500 isolates is completed and includes strains that are drug susceptible, mono resistant, MDR and XDR. Data on more than 6,000 isolates in the public domain and from other collaborations has also been analysed.
