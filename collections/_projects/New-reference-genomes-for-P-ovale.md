Despite <i>Plasmodium ovale curtisi (Poc)</i> and <i>wallikeri (Pow)</i> being important human-infecting malaria parasites that are widespread across Africa and Asia, little is known about their genome diversity. Morphologically identical, <i>Poc</i> and <i>Pow</i> are indistinguishable and commonly misidentified. Recent rises in the incidence of <i>Poc/Pow</i> infections have renewed efforts to address fundamental knowledge gaps in their biology, and to develop diagnostic tools to understand their epidemiological dynamics and malaria burden. A major roadblock has been the incompleteness of available reference assemblies (PocGH01, PowCR01; ~ 33.5 Mbp). Here, we applied multiple sequencing platforms and advanced bioinformatics tools to generate new reference genomes, Poc221 (South Sudan; 36.0 Mbp) and Pow222 (Nigeria; 34.3 Mbp), with improved nuclear genome contiguity (> 4.2 Mbp), annotation and completeness (> 99% <i>Plasmodium</i> spp., single copy orthologs). Subsequent sequencing of 6 <i>Poc</i> and 15 <i>Pow</i> isolates from Africa revealed a total of 22,517 and 43,855 high-quality core genome SNPs, respectively. Genome-wide levels of nucleotide diversity were determined to be 2.98 × 10–4 <i>(Poc)</i> and 3.43 × 10–4 <i>(Pow)</i>, comparable to estimates for other <i>Plasmodium</i> species. Overall, the new reference genomes provide a robust foundation for dissecting the biology of <i>Poc/Pow</i>, their population structure and evolution, and will contribute to uncovering the recombination barrier separating these species.
