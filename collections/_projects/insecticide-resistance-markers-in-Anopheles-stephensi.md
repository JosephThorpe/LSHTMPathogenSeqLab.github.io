Since its first detection in 2012 in Djibouti, <i>Anopheles stephensi</i> has invaded and established in the Horn of Africa, and more recently Nigeria. The expansion of this vector poses a significant threat to malaria control and elimination efforts. Integrated vector management is the primary strategy used to interrupt disease transmission; however, growing insecticide resistance is threatening to reverse gains in global malaria control. We present a next-generation amplicon-sequencing approach, for high-throughput monitoring of insecticide resistance genes (<i>ace1, GSTe2, vgsc and rdl</i>), species identification and characterization of genetic diversity (<i>its2</i> and <i>cox1</i>) in <i>An. stephensi</i>. Ninety-five <i>An. stephensi</i> mosquitoes, collected in Ethiopia, were screened, identifying 104 SNPs, including the knock-down mutation L958F (L1014F in <i>Musca domestica</i>), and for the first time in this vector species, the A296S substitution (A301S in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>) in the <i>rdl</i> locus. Two other amino acid substitutions (<i>ace1</i>-N177D, <i>GSTe2</i>-V189L) were also identified but have not been previously implicated in insecticide resistance. Genetic diversity in the mitochondrial <i>cox1</i> gene revealed shared haplotypes between Ethiopian <i>An. stephensi</i> with samples from Pakistan, Sudan, and Djibouti. Overall, we present a reliable, cost-effective strategy using amplicon-sequencing to monitor known insecticide resistance mutations, with the potential to identify new genetic variants, to assist in the high-throughput surveillance of insecticide resistance in <i>An. stephensi</i> populations.
