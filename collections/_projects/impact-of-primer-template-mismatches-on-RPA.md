Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) is an isothermal amplification assay which has been ubiquitously utilised in the detection of infectious agents. Like any nucleic acid amplification technology, primer-template complementarity is critical to RPA reaction success. Mismatches arising in the primer-template complex are known to impact reaction kinetics, invalidate downstream analysis such as nucleic acid quantification, and result in false negatives if used in a diagnostic capacity. Whilst the impact of specific primer-template mismatches has been well characterised for techniques such as Polymerase Chain Reaction, characterisation remains limited for RPA. Through our study we systematically characterise the impact of mismatches on the RPA reaction, when located in the 3'-anchor region of the primer-template complex. Our investigation identified that the nucleotides involved, as well as position of each mismatch, influence the size of the impact, with terminal Cytosine-Thymine and Guanine-Adenine mismatches being the most detrimental. The presence of some mismatch combinations such as a penultimate Cytosine-Cytosine and a terminal Cytosine-Adenine mismatch pairing led to complete RPA reaction inhibition. Through the successful characterisation of 315 mismatch combinations, researchers can optimise their RPA assay accordingly and seek to implement RPA technology for rapid, in-field genotyping.
