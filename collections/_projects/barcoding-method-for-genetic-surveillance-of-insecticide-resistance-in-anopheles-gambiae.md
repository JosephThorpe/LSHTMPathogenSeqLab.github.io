Surveillance of malaria vector species and the monitoring of insecticide resistance are essential to inform malaria control strategies and support the reduction of infections and disease. Genetic barcoding of mosquitoes is a useful tool to assist the high-throughput surveillance of insecticide resistance, discriminate between sibling species and to detect the presence of <i>Plasmodium</i> infections. In this study, we combined multiplex PCR, custom designed dual indexing, and Illumina next generation sequencing for high throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-profiling of four species from the <i>Anopheles (An.) gambiae</i> complex (<i>An. gambiae sensu stricto, An. coluzzii, An. arabiensis and An. melas</i>). By amplifying and sequencing only 14 genetic fragments (500 bp each), we were able to simultaneously detect <i>Plasmodium</i> infection; insecticide resistance-conferring SNPs in <i>ace1</i>, <i>gste2</i>, <i>vgsc</i> and <i>rdl</i> genes; the partial sequences of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and intergenic spacers (IGS), Short INterspersed Elements (SINE), as well as mitochondrial genes (<i>cox1</i> and <i>nd4</i>) for species identification and genetic diversity. Using this amplicon sequencing approach with the four selected <i>An. gambiae</i> complex species, we identified a total of 15 non-synonymous mutations in the insecticide target genes, including previously described mutations associated with resistance and two new mutations (F1525L in <i>vgsc</i> and D148E in <i>gste2</i>). Overall, we present a reliable and cost-effective high-throughput panel for surveillance of <i>An. gambiae</i> complex mosquitoes in malaria endemic regions.
