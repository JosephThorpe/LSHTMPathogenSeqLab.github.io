<i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites resistant to antimalarial treatments have hindered malaria disease control. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) was used globally as a first-line treatment for malaria after wide-spread resistance to chloroquine emerged and, although replaced by artemisinin combinations, is currently used as intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy and in young children as part of seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis in sub-Saharan Africa. The emergence of SP-resistant parasites has been predominantly driven by cumulative build-up of mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase (<i>pfdhfr</i>) and dihydropteroate synthetase (<i>pfdhps</i>) genes, but additional amplifications in the folate pathway rate-limiting <i>pfgch1</i> gene and promoter, have recently been described. However, the genetic make-up and prevalence of those amplifications is not fully understood. We analyse the whole genome sequence data of 4,134 <i>P. falciparum</i> isolates across 29 malaria endemic countries, and reveal that the <i>pfgch1</i> gene and promoter amplifications have at least ten different forms, occurring collectively in 23% and 34% in Southeast Asian and African isolates, respectively. Amplifications are more likely to be present in isolates with a greater accumulation of <i>pfdhfr</i> and <i>pfdhps</i> substitutions (median of 1 additional mutations; P greater than 0.00001), and there was evidence that the frequency of <i>pfgch1</i> variants may be increasing in some African populations, presumably under the pressure of SP for chemoprophylaxis and anti-folate containing antibiotics used for the treatment of bacterial infections. The selection of <i>P. falciparum</i> with <i>pfgch1</i> amplifications may enhance the fitness of parasites with <i>pfdhfr</i> and <i>pfdhps</i> substitutions, potentially threatening the efficacy of this regimen for prevention of malaria in vulnerable groups. Our work describes new <i>pfgch1</i> amplifications that can be used to inform the surveillance of SP drug resistance, its prophylactic use, and future experimental work to understand functional mechanisms.
