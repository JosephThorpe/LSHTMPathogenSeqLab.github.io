The Philippines is a high burden country for both TB and multi-drug resistant-TB (MDR-TB) (WHO, 2015). Whole genome sequencing of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> can be used to characterise strain-types linked to virulence, identify drug resistance mutations, assist clinical treatment decision-making, as well as establish who may have transmitted to whom and thus allow targeted resources to hotspot areas to reduce transmission. The UK-Philippine collaboration proposes to characterise <i>M. tuberculosis</i> samples from subjects from the recently completed Philippine-wide 2nd DR Survey (n>1,000). <i>M. tuberculosis</i> strains at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicineâ€™s National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (RITM-NTRL, Philippines) will be sequenced with the assistance of the Philippines Genome Centre (PGC) using cutting-edge whole genome sequencing technology. This project aims to determine the genomic diversity of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> in the Philippines.
