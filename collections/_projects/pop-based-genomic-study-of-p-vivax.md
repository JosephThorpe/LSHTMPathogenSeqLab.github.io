Whilst P. vivax infections pose a serious risk to global health, genomic analyses of this species, particularly in South America where the parasite is predominant, are scarce in comparison to the more pathogenic P. falciparum. Brazil is a unique setting for malaria transmission, with distinct foci relating to the local environments and resultant vector landscapes. To date, all previously published WGS data from Brazil has originated from isolates obtained mainly from Acre and a few from Rond√¥nia, in the north-western region of the country. Previous population genomic analyses have demonstrated that South American isolates (n = 146) are a distinct population with high genetic diversity,28 with three ancestral populations (Mexico, Peru, Colombia/Brazil),34 in contrast to our study, which reveals four main populations (n = 315; Brazil, Mexico/Colombia, Peru, Panama). Previous work has revealed geographical clustering of isolates from Brazil and Peru,28 but whilst closely related in our analysis, they are distinct. Earlier work focused solely on Mancio Lima, and found high levels of inbreeding.44 Studies of P. vivax from 4 countries (Brazil, Colombia, PNG, India), using microsatellite markers, have demonstrated high similarity between isolates from Brazil (Manaus) and India (Bikaner), and high genetic diversity irrespective of the transmission situation.98 Microsatellite data has also shown high diversity within and between Amazon parasite populations (Manaus, Porto Velho), with Amapa and Para infections being the most divergent,99 consistent with our findings that also suggest these two states are a distinct diverged clade.
