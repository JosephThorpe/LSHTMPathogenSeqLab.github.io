Following integrated malaria control interventions, malaria burden on the Bijagós Archipelago has significantly decreased. Understanding the genomic diversity of circulating Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites can assist infection control, through identifying drug resistance mutations and characterising the complexity of population structure. This study presents the first whole genome sequence data for P. falciparum isolates from the Bijagós Archipelago. Amplified DNA from P. falciparum isolates sourced from dried blood spot samples of 15 asymptomatic malaria cases were sequenced. Using 1.3 million SNPs characterised across 795 African P. falciparum isolates, population structure analyses revealed that isolates from the archipelago cluster with samples from mainland West Africa and appear closely related to mainland populations; without forming a separate phylogenetic cluster. This study characterises SNPs associated with antimalarial drug resistance on the archipelago. We observed fixation of the PfDHFR mutations N51I and S108N, associated with resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, and the continued presence of PfCRT K76T, associated with chloroquine resistance. These data have relevance for infection control and drug resistance surveillance; particularly considering expected increases in antimalarial drug use following updated WHO recommendations, and the recent implementation of seasonal malaria chemoprevention and mass drug administration in the region.
