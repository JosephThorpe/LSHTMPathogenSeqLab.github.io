During my master's, I developed the technique for MDR-TB detection that might be applied for low-resource settings. For my PhD, I studied the effect of using CRISRP interference as a complementary strategy to improve the effect of current anti-TB agents. Now, we are focusing on the development of technique that can simultaneously differentiate TB and NTM including identify the drug-resistant genes.
