Bioinformatician by training and with the Campino/Clark group since September 2019. On daily basis, I work with large-scale genome sequencing data from the _Plasmodium_ parasites on comperative and population genomics, both exploring novel data, getting new insights from existing datasets and also working on assemblies for new reference genomes.
