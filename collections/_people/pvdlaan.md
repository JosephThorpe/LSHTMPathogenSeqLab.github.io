I graduated from the University of Newcastle with a Bachelors in Natural History Illustration. Interested in zoonotic diseases I pursued an MSci in Wildlife Health Sciences at the Royal Veterinary College. From there I became passionate about vector borne diseases landing me in my current LIDo PhD at the LSHTM to research vector genomics and bioinformatics. And am still incorporating my scientific illustrations into my work.
