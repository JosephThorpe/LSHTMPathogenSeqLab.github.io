I graduated in Medical Technology from Khon Kaen University, Thailand, and later earned an MSc in Bioinformatics from Queen Mary University of London, gaining programming skills and expertise in variant analysis with tools like Exomiser. Since 2016, I've been a researcher at the Department of Medical Sciences, focusing on pharmacogenomics, rare diseases, and cancer genetics. Additionally, I managed a project developing a digital platform for sharing pharmacogenetic data via Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR).
