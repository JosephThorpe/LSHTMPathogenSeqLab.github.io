I graduated in biology, earned a Master's degree in parasitology, and am currently a PhD student in applied microbiology and parasitology at the Federal Fluminense University where it is a spli-PhD that is also located here at LSHTM. My research experience includes malaria, rotaviruses, and arthropod-borne viruses, especially Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya viruses.
