Completed my undergraduate in Biomedical Sciences from Kingâ€™s College London and postgraduate MSc in Control of Infectious Diseases at LSHTM, which has driven my passion towards tackling parasitic and vector-borne diseases, cumulating into a PhD. I have more fundamentals in wet-lab techniques and practices but slowly growing use to the dry-lab side of science.
