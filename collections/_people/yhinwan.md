I graduated with a degree in Medical Technology from Khon Kaen University, Thailand. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, at the same university. My research focuses on bioinformatics, particularly bacterial genomics. Since 2019, I have been working on the genomic analysis of Burkholderia pseudomallei, a highly adaptable and pathogenic bacterium responsible for melioidosis.
