Graduated from the University of York in Biochemistry and LSHTM with an MSc in Medical Parasitology after a brief stint in finance. Fell in love with bioinformatics at LSHTM, so glad to be back as a PhD student on the BBSRC LIDo Doctoral Programme investigating the genomic diversity of non-falciparum malaria species!
